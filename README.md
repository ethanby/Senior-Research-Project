# Analyzing User Behavior and Dependency Patterns in Navigation Apps 

**By: Ethan Byers**

### Objective: Conduct a survey to measure behavioral patterns in users of navigation apps

There are two main components to my survey research. The first is the .csv file containing all survey questions and responses.
Questions 21-35 are formatted in such a way to calculate a dependency score based on what answers were given by respondents.
The first answer choice is the more *dependent* option, the second choice demonstrates moderate dependency, while the third choice suggests no dependency toward navigation apps.

Using seniorresearch.py we can run the results through the program to automatically determine each respondents dependency score depending on their answers for these 15 questions.
A score between 0 and 10 suggests no dependency, 11-20 suggests moderate dependency, and 21-30 indicates high dependency.

I have deemed the rest of the questions on the survey as more general behavioral insights into users of navigation apps rather than usable to objectively determine someones dependency level.
